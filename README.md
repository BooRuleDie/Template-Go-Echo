# To Do

- [ ] Check missing parts in the Makefile after the template is almost done like race condition check, security check etc
- [ ] Don't forget i18n
- [ ] Standard Error & Success Response
- [ ] Centralized Error Handling
- [ ] Transaction Test
- [ ] Add unit test for `getRandomValueFromMap`
- [ ] Implement i18n based on the `locale` cookie and `Accept-Language` headers, giving higher priority to the `locale` cookie.
